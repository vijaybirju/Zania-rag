## Features

- Upload PDF files for content extraction
- Input multiple questions (one per line)
- Retrieves answers for each question from the content of the uploaded PDF
- Uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model for generating responses
- Simple and interactive web interface built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
